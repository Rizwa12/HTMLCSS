        By default a box is sized just big
enough to hold its contents. To
set your own dimensions for a
box you can use the height and
width properties.
The most popular ways to
specify the size of a box are
to use pixels, percentages, or
ems. Traditionally, pixels have
been the most popular method
because they allow designers to
accurately control their size.
When you use percentages,
the size of the box is relative to
the size of the browser
