                This example demonstrates a modern magazine-style layout using the 960.gs grid. Using this style sheet
                saves us from having to create all of the CSS code ourselves.
            </p>
            <p>
                Several classes from the 960.gs style sheet have been added to the code to indicate how many columns of
                the grid each element should stretch across. As you saw in this chapter, the 960.gs stylesheet uses the
                float property to position the blocks next to each other.

            </p>
            <p>
                At the start of the page, the header uses fixed positioning (meaning that it does not move when the user
                scrolls down the page). The z-index property is added to the header to keep it on top of the remaining
                content as the user scrolls down the page.

            </p>

        </div>
        <div class="section-right">
            <h1>Section right</h1>
            <p>
                The feature article takes up the entire width of the page. The push_7 and push_9 classes are part of the
                960.gs style sheet and are used in the feature article to move the header and the content for this
                article over to the right.
            </p>
