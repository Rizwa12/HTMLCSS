        At the top of a long page
        you might want to add a list
        of contents that links to the corresponding sections lower down. Or you might want to add a link from part way
        down the page back to the top of it to save users from having to scroll back to the top.
        Before you can link to a specific part of a page, you need to identify the points in the page that the link will
        go to. You do this using the id attribute (which can be used on every HTML element). You can see that the
        elements in this example have been given id attributes that identify those sections of the page.
